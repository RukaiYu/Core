### Different appearance (shell)

Because the program has the ability to replace the shell. Some developers will develop a program without a shell. Let the users choose the shell of the program. For example, you might develop a calculator program. When the user is editing the spreadsheet, the calculator will appear on one side of the Excel program. When the user browses the web page, the calculator will appear on one side of the browser. In this case, the developer can make these scenes into different Bundles and display them in the Launcher.

### Add and remove features

If you are developing an enterprise in-house application. There will be many separate small features. After some time, you may need to release new features. At this point, you can post these features as a Bundle to the Launcher.

### Permissions

Developers can control whether the Bundle on the Launcher is displayed based on the permissions.

### Online Launcher

In the future, Tangram will build an online Launcher. Developers can publish their own shells or components based on this Launcher. Other developers can use them as needed.
